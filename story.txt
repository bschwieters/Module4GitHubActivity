There once was a famous basketball player who lived in San Francisco, California. -ishan
He was happily married to Zendaya and had two daughters together.  -ishan
Recently, he signed a NBA contract with the Golden State Warriors for 100 million dollars. -ishan
Zendaya also began to receive many offers for new movies and TV shows.
The family began to look for a new house because of their financial stability. -ishan
The couple had so much money that they did not know how to spend it! -ishan

They decided that the best house that they could buy would be one that was made of gold. - Connor
This turned out to not be a very good idea since gold is not very durable and as soon as it was built it
collapsed, killing all of the construction workers. Zendaya and the basketball players were then haunted by the
golden ghosts of a hundred construction workers which was not very fun.

These ghosts were causing the basketball player to miss of his free throw shots. - Brock
These ghosts were also causing Zendaya to trip every time she would try out for an acting roll.
When pleading with the ghosts for how to make all this stop the ghosts said they had to admit making a
house out of gold was a bad idea. They could not do this becuase they had too much ego so they both
lost all there money and are now homeless.
